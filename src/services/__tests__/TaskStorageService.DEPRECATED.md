# Deprecated TaskStorageService Tests

As of the Phase 2 Supabase migration (#109), TaskStorageService has been completely rewritten to use Supabase directly instead of local storage. This means the following test files are no longer valid:

## Deprecated Test Files:

- `TaskStorageService.test.js` - Tests for local storage implementation
- `TaskStorageService.compat.test.js` - Tests for backward compatibility with old format
- `TaskStorageService.race.test.js` - Tests for race conditions in local storage
- `TaskStorageService.performance.test.js` - Performance tests for local storage chunking

## Current Test File:

- `TaskStorageService.supabase.test.js` - Tests for the new Supabase implementation

## Migration Notes:

The new TaskStorageService:

- Uses Supabase for all data persistence
- Includes real-time subscriptions
- Has built-in caching for performance
- No longer needs local storage chunking or race condition handling (handled by Supabase)

To run the current tests:

```bash
npm test -- --testPathPattern=TaskStorageService.supabase.test.js
```
