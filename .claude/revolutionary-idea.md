# Generate Revolutionary Ideas

Generate revolutionary ideas for: $ARGUMENTS

## Phase 1: Context Analysis

First, deeply understand the current state:

- What exists today in this space?
- What are the fundamental assumptions?
- What constraints are real vs. perceived?
- Who are the stakeholders and what do they value?

## Phase 2: Paradigm Breaking

Challenge every assumption:

- What if we did the exact opposite?
- What would this look like in 10 years?
- How would a child approach this?
- What would alien technology enable?
- How did nature solve similar problems?

## Phase 3: Cross-Domain Innovation

Apply patterns from other fields:

- How would a game designer approach this?
- What can we learn from biology/physics?
- How do social networks solve similar problems?
- What would a distributed system architect do?
- How would an artist reimagine this?

## Phase 4: Idea Generation

Generate 10 revolutionary concepts:

1. The most technically ambitious approach
2. The simplest possible solution
3. The most user-delightful version
4. The most scalable architecture
5. The AI-first implementation
6. The community-driven approach
7. The zero-cost solution
8. The premium luxury version
9. The open-source ecosystem play
10. The moonshot that changes everything

## Phase 5: Feasibility Mapping

For the top 3 ideas:

- Technical requirements and challenges
- Resource needs (time, money, people)
- Key risks and mitigation strategies
- Potential impact at scale
- Path to prototype in 1 week

## Phase 6: Synthesis

Combine the best elements:

- Create a hybrid approach
- Define the MVP version
- Outline the full vision
- Identify quick wins
- Plan the revolution

## Output Format

Present findings as:

1. **Executive Summary** (2-3 sentences)
2. **Top 3 Revolutionary Ideas** (with pros/cons)
3. **Recommended Approach** (with rationale)
4. **Next Steps** (concrete actions)
5. **Prototype Proposal** (1-week sprint plan)

Remember: True innovation happens at the intersection of the impossible and the inevitable. Think bigger!
